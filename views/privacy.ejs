        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Sportsurge does not collect personal information, create user profiles,
            or require registration. We do not ask for names, emails, or payment details.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our servers may temporarily log basic technical information such as
            IP address, browser type, device information, and requested pages.
            These logs are used strictly for security, performance monitoring,
            and website stability, and are never linked to individual identities.
        </p>

        <h2>Advertising Partners</h2>
        <p>
            Sportsurge displays advertisements provided by third-party advertising
            networks. These partners may use cookies, device identifiers, or similar
            technologies to display relevant ads based on general usage patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
            We do not control, access, or store any data collected by advertisers,
            and we do not combine advertising data with any site activity.
            Please review the privacy policies of ad providers for more details.

        <h2>Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            Sportsurge does not set analytics or tracking cookies.
            Third-party advertisers may use cookies to measure ad performance
            or personalize ads.

        <p>
            You may disable cookies through your browser settings.
            Please note that blocking advertising cookies may affect ad relevance,
            but will not restrict access to our site.
        </p>

        <h2>External Links</h2>
        <p>
            Our website contains links to third-party streaming sources and
            external websites. Sportsurge is not responsible for the content,
            data handling, or privacy practices of external sites.
        </p>

            We strongly recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any third-party
            websites you visit through links on Sportsurge.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We apply reasonable technical safeguards to protect the limited
            server-generated data we maintain. However, no method of data transmission
            or storage over the internet is completely secure.
